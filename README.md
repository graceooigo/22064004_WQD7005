Case Study: E-Commerce Customer Behaviour Analysis

This case study is to work with a dataset of customer transactions from an e-commerce website,
encompassing various customer attributes and purchase history over the last year. To perform the E-Commerce customer behaviour analysis, the following tasks will be performed:

1.	Generate a dataset 
2.	Import the dataset and preprocessing
3.	Built data mining models - Decision Tree, Ensemble Methods
4.	Analyse the results.

Objective

1.	To identify the key features that affect E-comm customer attrition.
2.	To identify the optimal algorithm from DT and RF that can accurately predict customer churn based on evaluation of performance metrics.
3.	To provide customer retention strategies based on insights gained from the analysis.

About Dataset

The dataset contains 13 features as follows:
Customer ID: A unique identifier for each customer.
Customer Name: The name of the customer (generated by Faker).
Customer Age: The age of the customer (generated by Faker).
Gender: The gender of the customer (generated by Faker).
Purchase Date: The date of each purchase made by the customer.
Product Category: The category or type of the purchased product.
Product Price: The price of the purchased product.
Quantity: The quantity of the product purchased.

Payment Method: The method of payment used by the customer (e.g., credit card, PayPal).
Returns: Whether the customer returned any products from the order (binary: 0 for no return, 1 for return).
Churn: A binary column indicating whether the customer has churned (0 for retained, 1 for churned).


Software used:
Talend Data Prep – To perform data preprocessing
Talend Data Integration – To integrate the dataset
SAS e-Miner – To handle missing value and built model like Decision tree
